To-Do - Robot integration

Files excluding C++ code:

Launch_package
- launch_app.launch.py - Done
- launch_drivers.launch.py - Done

Standalone_Trajectory_Executor
- executor_params.yaml - Done

Object Detector
- rv5as.urdf.xacro (/config/) - Done

Machine State Control
- machine_state_control.launch.py - Done
- /config/rv5as.urdf.xacro -- ???? - Done
- /config/rv4as_params.yaml - Done




Needed additions:

- irb120_moveit_config to replace melfa_rv5as_moveit_config : Used by machine_state_control.launch.py etc, and used by the motion planning.
  

- irb120_controller replacement for rv5as_controller : Used by /Standalone_Trajectory_Executor/config/executor_params.yaml
- irb120 rviz packages : Used by app launch.

- Look into abb_bringup launches : Used by driver launch, in melfa they were both seperate packages, here they appear the same package.
  Working on abb_moveit.launch.py

- custom_io_params.yaml needs to be updated : Used by control launch in rv5as version, and as rv5as_hardware shortcut in melfa_description urdf files.
